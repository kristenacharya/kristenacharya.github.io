                <p>Hi there! My name is Kristen Acharya, and I'm a software engineer. Five years ago, after hastily completing a Udemy Web Development course, I was offered an internship at a digital agency. Shortly after, I was hired on full time and allowed to work on a broad spectrum of projects. </p>
                <p>I spent the next three years tackling legacy projects written in ColdFusion, PHP, and early versions of Laravel. I also contributed my own code to some new projects in Laravel, Phalcon, and Vue. A good portion of my time was spent writing MySQL queries to produce custom data sets for clients, and this remains my favorite task.</p>
                <p>My current role allows me the best of all worlds: abundant query writing and data analysis, coding in new (to me) frameworks and languages, and producing/interacting with API's to share data between all the platforms we use.</p>
                <p>The rest of my time is devoted to my little family. My husband of 15 years is a web solutions architect, and we have a 3 year old daughter.</p>
